## Database Schema Design

### Core Tables
```sql

users (
  id, email, password_hash, role, name, bio, 
  phone, address, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Venues
venues (
  id, user_id, name, address, phone, website,
  description, capacity, amenities, created_at
)

-- Events
events (
  id, venue_id, title, description, start_time,
  end_time, price, category, status, created_at
)

-- Magazine Issues
magazine_issues (
  id, title, month_year, cover_image, 
  published_at, status
)

-- Articles
articles (
  id, issue_id, title, content, author_id,
  featured_image, published_at, status
)

-- Playlists
playlists (
  id, curator_id, title, description, 
  tracks, created_at
)

-- Advertisements
advertisements (
  id, advertiser_id, issue_id, ad_type,
  content, payment_status, created_at
)
```

## API Design

### Core Endpoints
```
Authentication:
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout

Events:
GET /api/events/today
GET /api/events/upcoming
GET /api/events/:id
POST /api/events (venue only)
PUT /api/events/:id (venue only)

Venues:
GET /api/venues
GET /api/venues/:id
POST /api/venues (admin only)

Magazine:
GET /api/magazine/issues
GET /api/magazine/issues/:id
GET /api/magazine/articles

Playlists:
GET /api/playlists
GET /api/playlists/:id
POST /api/playlists (curator only)

Payments:
POST /api/payments/create-intent
POST /api/payments/confirm
```

## UI/UX Considerations

### Website Features
- **Hero Section**: Today's events prominently displayed
- **Event Calendar**: Interactive calendar view
- **Venue Directory**: Map and list of venues
- **Artist Profiles**: Featured artist pages
- **Magazine Archive**: Digital magazine access
- **Playlist Integration**: Curated music playlists

### Mobile App Features
- **Daily Events**: First screen shows today's events
- **Event Details**: Tap for full event information
- **Venue Navigation**: Directions and contact info
- **Push Notifications**: Event reminders
- **Offline Mode**: Basic event info when offline

### Key User Flows
1. **Event Discovery**: User opens app → sees today's events → taps event → gets details
2. **Venue Management**: Venue logs in → adds event → pays listing fee → event appears
3. **Magazine Reading**: User browses magazine → reads articles → discovers events
4. **Playlist Integration**: User discovers playlist → listens to music → learns about artists
